## About The Project

**AI Forex Mentor** is an innovative educational and analytical platform designed to demystify the complexity of the Forex market. Our goal is not to provide "ready-made signals," but to equip traders with the knowledge and tools to make their own informed decisions.

Using advanced AI models, the application analyzes market data in real-time and translates complex phenomenaâ€”such as sudden trend changes, reactions to news, or market sentimentâ€”into simple, understandable language. It's like having a personal mentor by your side, available 24/7.
